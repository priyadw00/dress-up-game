# dress-up-game

DESCRIPTION
A dress up game in the style of Adobe Flash games that were popular with children in the early 2010s. Players begin with a blank model and can navigate between serveral different closets to dress the model in tops, bottoms, and accesories. When finished, the players can click done and move to an ending screen with the final outfit on a new background.   

The game is implemented entirely in Python, with the use of the graphics package created by John Zelle and a number of public domain images as well as digital artwork by Yaya Callahan. 

CONTRIBUTERS 
Priya Dalal-Whelan and Yaya Callahan.

ISSUES AND RESOLUTIONS 
There are extra blank buttons that should be cut out or used for an additional closet. 

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 
The game is easily expandable by adding more outfit and acessory options, or different backgrounds for the ending screen.
